Subject: No Work Permit Requirement

Hello {speaker},

In a previous e-mail, we asked you to fill out a small form with border
crossing information, due to a concern about Canadian border restrictions
regarding conferences.

Now that a schedule has been finalized and we've had a chance to have our
lawyers look over everything, said lawyers have determined that no work
permit will be required to enter Canada, and we do not anticipate any
issues.

Thank you!
