Subject: PyCon 2013: Please consider submitting your talk to PyData!

Dear {speaker} --

I thought you might like to know about another opportunity to present
your talk:

PyData 2013 will be running just after PyCon, in the same convention
center, and is looking for speakers. The PyData organizers have asked
me fpr strong proposals that would fit in well at PyData but that we
couldn't take at PyCon; yours is one of those.

I'd like to encourage you to send your proposal on to PyData: send it
to pydataconf@continuum.io. The deadline is December 15th, and your
proposal should include your bio and your talk's abstract

PyData is semi-annual event for scientists, engineers, and data
analysts in the Python community. The conference focuses on techniques
and tools for management, analytics, and visualization of data of
different types and sizes with particular emphasis on big data. This
year it'll be held directly after PyCon, on March 18 - 20, in the same
venue (the Santa Clara Convention Center).

If you've got any questions feel free to contact me (jacob@jacobian.org)
or the PyData organizers (pydataconf@continuum.io).

Thanks!
