Subject: PyCon 2014: Proposal Decision – {title}

Dear {speaker},

Thank you very much for your PyCon 2014 talk proposal,
"{title}".

Unfortunately, your talk was not one of the ones selected to appear at
PyCon 2014.

As you may know, we once again had record-breaking levels of talk
submissions -- over 650 proposals were submitted. Both the quantity
and the quality of proposals were breathtaking. Sadly, we have just
95 spots on the schedule, so many excellent talks couldn't be
accommodated.

I know you spent a lot of time working on your proposal, and receiving
a form letter rejection stings. If you'd like specific feedback on why
your talk was rejected, please contact me (luke@sneeringer.com). I'll
be happy to look through the committee's notes and give you a summary.

I do hope you'll choose to come to PyCon regardless. It's an amazing
conference, and we do have several venues in which you could still
deliver your material: lightning talks (quick, five-minute talks on
any topic) and open spaces (dedicated rooms for informal, unscheduled
proposals and discussions).

See https://us.pycon.org/2014/about/what-is-pycon/ for more information.

If you plan to come, you should register at
https://us.pycon.org/2014/registration/ as soon as possible; we have a
limit of 2,000 tickets, and we expect to sell out. Please don't delay
in picking up your tickets!

If you need assistance with visas or immigration documents, please
contact Rami Chowdhury (rami.chowdhury@gmail.com).

If you have any other questions, comments, or feedback, please feel
free to contact me (luke@sneeringer.com), my co-chair, Alex Gaynor
(alex.gaynor@gmail.com), or the conference chair, Diana Clarke
(diana.joan.clarke@gmail.com).

On behalf of the PyCon staff, I want to thank you again for your
submission. You made our job picking talks very hard, and the
conference will be better for it.

I hope to see you in Montréal!
