Subject: PyCon 2014 Speaker Notes

Dear {speaker},
I hope you are all ready for PyCon, and as excited about it as I am!
I wanted to make you all aware of a few important notes:


===============
CRITICAL THINGS
===============

  * Speaker orientation will be Thursday, April 9, at 7:00 PM, in
    room 514C.  As in previous years, it will last roughly 30 minutes.
    Please attend even if you have spoken at PyCon before (procedures
    always change slightly from year to year).
  * If you are unable to attend orientation for whatever reason, please
    ensure that you arrive in the Green Room no less than 30 minutes
    before your talk.
  * Before your talk occurs, please arrive in the Green Room (room 448)
    at least 15 minutes before your talk's scheduled start time to meet up
    with your session runner. DO NOT go directly to your talk's room!!


===========
NICE THINGS
===========

  * There will be an optional tutorial/orientation for new speakers
    immediately after the first orientation.
  * The Green Room (room 448) is yours for the weekend, and can be used
    to find a quiet space, hang out with others, etc.


================
TECHNICAL THINGS
================

  * The projectors operate at 1024x768
  * Use high contrast colors and large fonts (minimum 24pt) for slides.
    Especially remember this for code samples, which can be more difficult
    to read.
  * Each podium will have a single power outlet and A/V adapters for VGA,
    HDML, DVI, Mini-DVI, and Mini-HDMI.
  * If you need any special equipment or support beyond this, please fill
    out [this form][1].


============
FINAL THINGS
============

  * Here are some [tips for giving programming talks][2].
  * Your session runner will help you test your equipment just before your
    talk.
  * Finally, it would be helpful (but not required) if you could add
    your phone number to [your speaker profile][3] — this is only accessable
    to a handful of PyCon staff members, and will only be used if we can’t
    find you before your talk, or some other emergency.
