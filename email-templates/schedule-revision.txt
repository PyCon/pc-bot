Subject: PyCon 2014 Draft Schedule Revisions

Dear {speaker},

Due to feedback from the e-mail blast yesterday, I've moved several talks
around to accomodate needs (usually travel concerns) of various speakers.

I have what I believe to be a final edit, available here:

    https://us.pycon.org/2014/schedule/talks/

Please check that your talk is still scheduled for a time you'll be able
to give it! If anything's wrong, please let me know **right away**:
Again, I plan to publish this schedule tomorrow (for real this time).
There is no need to reply unless there is a problem.

Thanks, and as always if you have any questions please feel free to
contact me (luke@sneeringer.com), my co-chair, Alex Gaynor,
(alex.gaynor@gmail.com), or the conference chair, Diana Clarke
(diana.joan.clarke@gmail.com).

See you in Montr√©al!
