Subject: PyCon 2014 Bookstore and Print Program

Dear {speaker},

I'm sending you this message because you have a talk for PyCon 2014 that has
been accepted.  I wanted to let you know about a couple things:

1. Bookstore

If you've written a book that is for sale, particularly if it's about the
topic on which you are speaker, we want to be sure that it's available
at the bookstore at PyCon.

Therefore, if you have an available book, please let us know by filling
out this form:

    https://pycon2014.wufoo.eu/forms/pycon-2014-bookstore/


2. The Print Program

We're just over a week away from doing a final export for the print program.
If you want to make any last-minute changes to what will appear in the
program for your talk, please send them to me within the next couple of days.


Thanks again for giving your time to speak at PyCon.


See you in Montr√©al!

Luke Sneeringer
Program Committee Chair, PyCon 2014
