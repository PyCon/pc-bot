Subject: PyCon 2014 draft schedule - please review!

Dear {speaker},

We now have what we believe will be a final schedule. Please take a
moment to review your talk's scheduled time:

    https://us.pycon.org/2014/schedule/talks/

Please check that your talk is scheduled for a time you'll be able
to give it! If anything's wrong, please let me know **right away**:
I plan to publish this schedule tomorrow.

I've tried my best to accommodate each speaker's preference for
talk length, day of conference, time of day, etc. In some cases,
however, this wasn't possible. In particular, we had more speakers
requesting 45 minute slots than we had 45 minute slots available, so
you may not have been allocated the time you requested. If you're in
that camp, please do try to make the talk fit  within the shorter
time slot. If you absolutely can't, please let me know right away.

I also want to remind you that, if you haven't already, **please**
fill out the form regarding Canadian border crossing, in order to ensure
that we don't have any issues with immigration.
