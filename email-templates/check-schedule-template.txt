Subject: PyCon 2013 draft schedule - please review!

Dear {speaker},

Please take a moment to review your talk's scheduled time:

    Title: {title}
    Date: {day}
    Time: {start} - {stop} ({length})

You can see the overall schedule at:

    https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/talks/

Please check that your talk is scheduled for a time you'll be able
to give it! If anything's wrong, please let me know *right away*:
I plan to publish this schedule tomorrow.

I've tried my best to accommodate every speakers' preferences for
talk length, day of conference, time of day, etc. In some cases,
however, this wasn't possible: in particular, we had more speakers
requesting 45 minute slots than we had 45 minute slots available, so
you may not have been allocated the time you requested. If you're in
that camp, please do try to make the talk fit  within the shorter
time slot. If you absolutely can't, please let me know  right away.

I also want to remind you of a couple other things:

* If you haven't already registered for PyCon, please contact me
  immediately. Early-bird registration sold out a couple of weeks
  ago, but if you contact me I can still get you a ticket at
  early-bird prices. But please don't delay - we *will* sell out,
  and you need to have a ticket before we do.

* The deadline to apply for financial aid is December 31, 2012. If
  you need financial assistance to attend PyCon, PLEASE apply
  (and mention that you're a speaker). We don't want money to stand
  in the way of your talk!

Thanks, and as always if you have any questions please feel free to
contact me (jacob@jacobian.org), my co-chair, Luke Sneeringer
(luke@sneeringer.com), or the conference chair, Jesse Noller
(jnoller@python.org).

See you in Santa Clara!
