Subject: PyCon 2015 draft schedule - please review!

Dear {speaker},

I have written a draft schedule, which I have placed on Google Docs
at this address:

    https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Nlzs9iXy9G5YHbl046gxzlRcyuOelQD0bZ74RP-7s2M/edit?usp=sharing

Please check that your talk is scheduled for a time you'll be able
to give it! If anything's wrong, please let me know **right away**:
We plan to publish this schedule very soon.

I've tried my best to accommodate each speaker's preference for
talk length, day of conference, time of day, etc. In some cases,
however, this wasn't possible. In particular, we had more speakers
requesting 45 minute slots than we had 45 minute slots available, so
you may not have been allocated the time you requested. If you're in
that camp, please do try to make the talk fit within the shorter
time slot. If you absolutely can't, please let me know right away.

Thanks, and as always if you have any questions please feel free to
contact me (luke@sneeringer.com), my co-chair, Alex Gaynor,
(alex.gaynor@gmail.com), or the conference chair, Diana Clarke
(diana.joan.clarke@gmail.com).

See you in Montr√©al!
