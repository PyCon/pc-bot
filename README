Tools for PyCon-PC IRC meetings
===============================

Helpful tools for running the PyCon Program Commitee process. This runs and IRC
bot we use during meetings, and a web interface to the review data.

Setup
=====

First, the usual:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Then, rhe best way to configure this thing is through some environ variables
(there are flags, but env is easier)::

    export MONGO_DSN=mongodb://...
    export PYCONBOT_SUPERUSERS=list,of,irc,superusers

If you want to protect the web interface with (basic) auth::

    export PYCONBOT_BASIC_AUTH=username:password

(Yeah it's kinda janky. What. Ev. Er.)

The web app can be run in debug mode::

    export PYCONBOT_DEBUG=1

Then to run the bot:

    python runbot.py

This runs both the IRC client and the web server. See the `--help` for
connecting to other channels, listening on other HTTP ports, etc.

The scripts need to be able to import stuff from `pycon_bot`, so I usually

    export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`
    python scripts/agenda.py

Or somesuch.

Architecture
============

Some brief notes on how all the bits fit together:

* `runbot.py` launches an IRC "driver" (`pycon_bot.driver.PyConBot`). This bot
  doesn't do much itself besides provide some utilities. Instead, almost all
  bot commands get delegated down to a "mode" object.

* A "mode" lives in `pycon_bot.modes.<whatever>` It should subclass
  `pycon_bot.modes.base.BaseBotMode`, and the mode needs to be named, e.g.,
  `WhateverMode` if it lives in `pycon_bot.modes.whatever`.

* The ",mode" command switches between modes - see
  `pycon_bot.driver.PyConBot.handle_mode`. Giving invalid modes fails in
  predictable ways, and since it imports arbitrary code you probably want to
  be careful about where you run this and who gets SU!

* `runbot.py` also launches a web app, written using Flask. See
  `pycon_bot.web.app`.

Running IN THE CLOUDS!
======================

You can run this bad boy on Heroku::

    heroku create <appname>
    git push heroku master
    heroku config:set MONGO_DSN=mongodb://...
    heroku config:set PYCONBOT_SUPERUSERS=me,myself,andI
    heroku config:set PYCONBOT_BASIC_AUTH=username:password

Then to change code just do the standard `git push heroku master`.
