Tools for PyCon-PC IRC meetings
===============================

Helpful tools for running the PyCon Program Commitee process. This runs an IRC
bot we use during meetings, and a web interface to the review data.

Setup
=====

First, the usual:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Then, the best way to configure this thing is through some environ variables
(there are flags, but env is easier)::

    export MONGO_DSN=mongodb://...
    export PYCONBOT_SUPERUSERS=list,of,irc,superusers

If you want to protect the web interface with (basic) auth::

    export PYCONBOT_BASIC_AUTH=username:password

(Yeah it's kinda janky. What. Ev. Er.)

The web app can be run in debug mode::

    export PYCONBOT_DEBUG=1

Then to run the bot:

    python runbot.py

This runs both the IRC client and the web server. See the `--help` for
connecting to other channels, listening on other HTTP ports, etc.

The scripts need to be able to import stuff from `pycon_bot`, so I usually

    export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`
    python scripts/agenda.py

Or somesuch.

Architecture
============

Some brief notes on how all the bits fit together:

* `runbot.py` launches an IRC "driver" (`pycon_bot.driver.PyConBot`). This bot
  doesn't do much itself besides provide some utilities. Instead, almost all
  bot commands get delegated down to a "mode" object.

* A "mode" lives in `pycon_bot.modes.<whatever>` It should subclass
  `pycon_bot.modes.base.BaseMode`, and the mode class itself is named `Node`.

* The ",mode" command switches between modes - see
  `pycon_bot.driver.PyConBot.handle_mode`. Giving invalid modes fails in
  predictable ways, and since it imports arbitrary code you probably want to
  be careful about where you run this and who gets SU!

Running IN THE CLOUDS!
======================

You can run this bad boy on Heroku::

    heroku create <appname>
    git push heroku master
    heroku config:set PYCONBOT_SUPERUSERS=me,myself,andI
    heroku config:set PYCONBOT_NICK='pycon_bot'
    heroku config:set PYCON_API_KEY='00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000'
    heroku config:set PYCON_API_SECRET='00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000'
    heroku config:set PYCON_WEBSITE_HOST='us.pycon.org'

Then to change code just do the standard `git push heroku master`.
