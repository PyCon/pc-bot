In rough priority order

* Deploy to Heroku. Big question: security - if I can just /nick jacobkm we
  can't leave this running 24x7.
* Add a todo object and a ,todo command to record action items during each
  meeting (should this be ReviewMode-specific, or global?)
* Add an "edit" mode for messing with talk data. Alternatively, spin up
  mongonaut or something similar.
* Port over thunder mode (this is a big one, also requires more models and
  scripts to handle tdome groupings)
