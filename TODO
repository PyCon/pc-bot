In rough priority order

* Something's broken about the on-deck display, it's not going in the
  same order as the agenda.
* The initial "intros" should be handled by the bot so that we know who's
  here and who's not. then handle "who is" requests
  via PM.
* ",start X "should re-start meeting X (in case the bot has to reboot)
* Add a todo object and a ,todo command to record action items during each
  meeting (should this be ReviewMode-specific, or global?)
* Add an "edit" mode for messing with talk data. Alternatively, spin up
  mongonaut or something similar.
* Port over thunder mode (this is a big one, also requires more models and
  scripts to handle tdome groupings)
